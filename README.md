# Week3TestingWork5Mins

Seeing as I still have 20 seconds and I'm typing out the reflection now. I'd say I'm doing good.

Just now are you asking if someone hasn't completed it.

I would say that I'm doing okay. I could probably do it in about 3 minutes. The only reason I wouldn't be able to do this in under a minute is due to the Unity Project loading up and creating. Other than that
I'm doing good.

as for the project. It was a bit difficult to fix the syntax as I had to compare the text letter by letter with the slideshow text. Unfortunately the errors pointed at what was causign the issue and not specifically the origin
of what was causing the issue.

Overall, I did consult chatGPT for some syntax errors which helped me figure out that I had a ; instead of a : in one place, and a variable that wasn't equated to something.

Things work, and The Github is working fine, so we're good.
