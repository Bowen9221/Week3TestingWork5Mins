# Week3TestingWork5Mins

Seeing as I still have 20 seconds and I'm typing out the reflection now. I'd say I'm doing good.

Just now are you asking if someone hasn't completed it.

I would say that I'm doing okay. I could probably do it in about 3 minutes. The only reason I wouldn't be able to do this in under a minute is due to the Unity Project loading up and creating. Other than that
I'm doing good.
